## Overview

**Rock Paper Scissors x99** is a strategic and enhanced version of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game. In this game, each player selects **three moves** and distributes a total of **99 strength points** across these moves. Each round compares both the move type and its strength value to determine the winner.

This project was developed as part of the **[Create a Back-End App with JavaScript Skill Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-a-back-end-app-with-javascript)** offered by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## Game Rules

- Each player defines **3 moves**:
    - **Type:** `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`
    - **Value:** an integer strength value for each move

- The total strength points across the three moves must equal exactly **99**.
- Each move must have at least **1 point**.

### How Each Round Works:

1.  If the move types differ:
    -   Rock beats Scissors
    -   Scissors beats Paper
    -   Paper beats Rock
2.  If the move types are the same:
    -   The move with the **higher strength value** wins.
3.  If both moves have the same type and strength:
    -   The round is declared a **tie**.

The player who wins the **majority of the three rounds** wins the game.
